# [INFO-H515 - Big Data Scalable Analytics](https://uv.ulb.ac.be/course/view.php?id=85246)
# Docker container for the course and for Big Data Geospatial Analysis in Kafka & Spark Streaming (PySpark)

## Developed by Giovanni Buroni (Dockerfile), Jacopo De Stefani (Windows fixes) 

This Dockerfile sets up a complete streaming environment on Ubuntu 20.04 for experimenting with Kafka and Spark streaming (PySpark). It installs

* Kafka 3.0.0
* Spark 3.2.0 

It additionnally installs

* Anaconda distribution for Python 3.9;
* Jupyter notebook for Python; 
* Geopandas python package for geospatial data (http://geopandas.org/index.html).

## 0. Docker installation

Docker is a software container platform, which allows to isolate OS environments. Its main benefits over virtual machines are a reduced footprint (starting from 60MB for a Linux distribution - for example [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)), and an easy way reconfigure an OS environment. Note: The Docker container for this course is 7.7GB, mostly due to the Anaconda (>1GB) and Spark (>1GB) distributions.

For more information on Docker, see: 

* https://www.docker.com/what-docker
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)

**To download and install, see**: (NB: install the Community Edition)

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation

**Get started Docker tutorial:**

* https://docs.docker.com/get-started

We **strongly** encourage you to follow the tutorial, and learn how to build, run, pull and push a container.

**N.B.** - The installation procedure on Windows depends on the Windows version, further details are available in the following section of the README.

### 0.1 Windows specific installation instructions

On Windows, two different versions of the Docker Community Edition exists: Docker Desktop and Docker Toolbox for Windows.

- If your PC is running **Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later)**, then you need to install Docker Desktop as described in https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

- In for any other Windows 10 version and/or previous versions of Windows, you will need to install the Docker Toolbox for Windows as described in https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

## 1. Get started

In order to avoid building the image from scratch, a prebuilt image is made available from DockerHub, see below.

### 1.1. Pull image

#### Pull image and create a folder for your Project

**N.B.** - For the users of the Docker Toolbox for Windows, the following commands have to be run in the Docker Toolbox terminal.

The image is called ```ulb_infoh515``` and is available from DockerHub (Note: image is 7.7GB, make sure you have a reasonably good Internet conection).

To install the image, use the standard ```docker pull``` command 

```
docker pull jdestefani/ulb_infoh515
```

Git clone the repository for the course

```
git clone https://github.com/jdestefani/BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515
```

Cd to the `BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515` folder

```
cd BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515
```

Finally, give recursive permission to all for writing to it (ease the sharing with Docker container)

```
chmod -R a+rwx .
```

The Docker container should now be able to read/write to your **host ```BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515``` folder**.

### 1.2. Start container

### 1.2.1. Start Docker container

#### Linux / Mac

From the ```BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515``` folder, start the container with

```
docker run -v `pwd`:/home/guest/shared -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -p 23:22 -it jdestefani/ulb_infoh515 bash

```

#### Windows 

For Windows, the launching procedure is as follows:

1. Start Docker Toolbox Quickstart Terminal and wait until the startup process is completed.
2. Open a Windows Powershell terminal
3. Run the following command in a PowerShell terminal, **from the `BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515` folder**:

```
$nixPath = (($pwd.Path -replace "\\","/") -replace ":","").Trim("/"); $nixPath = "/"+$nixPath.substring(0,1).toLower()+$nixPath.substring(1); docker run -v ${nixPath}:/home/guest/shared -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -p 23:22 -it jdestefani/ulb_infoh515 bash

```

**Notes:**

* `-v` is used to share folder (right permissions given above will allow your changes to be saved on your computer). The "-v pwd:/home/guest/host" shares the local folder (i.e. folder containing Dockerfile, ipynb files, etc...) on your computer; 
* `-it` starts the Docker container in interactive mode, so you can use the console and Bash;
* `-p` is for sharing ports between the container and the host. 8888 is the notebook port, and 4040 the Spark UI port.

### 1.2.2. Connect and launch notebook server

Once the Docker has been launched, connect as user 'guest' and go to 'shared' folder (shared with the host), with the following commands:

```
su guest
```

```
cd shared
```

Start Jupyter notebook

```
notebook
```

and connect from your web browser of choice at port host:8888 (where 'host' is the IP for your host. If run locally on your computer, this should be 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.99.100, check Docker documentation).

**N.B. - For Windows users:** Some users have reported problems connecting to the Docker using Internet Explorer and Edge, using Chrome or Firefox, should solve these issues. 


### 1.2.3. Start Kafka and related services

**N.B.** The usage of Kafka will be required for the project and the practical sessions on Streaming Analytics. It is not required to run this part if Kafka is not needed in the practical.

Once run, you are logged in as root in the container. Run the startup_script.sh (in /usr/bin), with: 

```
kafka_startup_script.sh
```

to start:

* SSH server. You can connect to the container using user 'guest' and password 'guest'
* Zookeeper server
* Kafka server


### 1.2.4. SSH connection

**N.B.:** When running the docker for the first time with the docker run command, it is not required to connect to it through ssh as the terminal where the commands will be run is already connected to the docker. SSH could be used to open multiple terminals connected to the Docker.

Once the container is running, it is possible to connect to it through SSH with the following command:

```
ssh -p 23 guest@containerIP
```

where 'containerIP' is the IP of the container (127.0.0.1 or 192.168.99.100 according to the system). Password is 'guest'.

#### Connect to Spark UI

It is available in your browser at port 4040.


## 2. Container configuration details

The container is based on CentOS 6 Linux distribution. The main steps of the building process are

* Install some common Linux tools (wget, unzip, tar, ssh tools, ...), and Java (1.8)
* Create a guest user (UID important for sharing folders with host!, see below), and install Spark and sbt, Kafka, Anaconda and Jupyter notbooks for the guest user
* Go back to root user, and install startup script (for starting SSH), sentenv.sh script to set up environment variables (JAVA, Kafka, Spark, ...)and spark-default.conf 


### User UID

In the Dockerfile, the line

```
RUN useradd guest -u 1000
```

creates the user under which the container will be run as a guest user. The username is 'guest', with password 'guest', and the '-u' parameter sets the linux UID for that user.

In order to make sharing of folders easier between the container and your host, **make sure this UID matches your user UID on the host**. You can see what your host UID is with

```
echo $UID
```

## 3. Troubleshooting

#### Issue: 127.0.0.1 refused to connect

On some versions of Mac OSX and Windows, the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) is used instead of the native Docker Engine on the system.

In this case, instead of connecting to the IP address of the localhost (i.e. 127.0.0.1), one should connect to the IP address of the virtual machine where the Docker Engine is running (192.168.99.100, by default).

For example, to connect to the Jupyter Notebook, you should open your browser at 192.168.99.100:8888

Sometimes, the cause of this problem could be related to the used web browser (namely Internet Explorer and Edge), in this case, testing the same IP on a different browser (Chrome, Firefox) could solve the issue.

#### Issue: Shared folder empty

The [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) on Windows 10 Home shares by default only the primary hard drive (i.e. the one where Windows is installed -> C:).

In case your machine has more than one hard disk two solutions exists:
- Either the BigDataAnalytics_INFOH515 folder has to be located **on the main hard drive (C:) and inside the User folder (for example inside Documents, Desktop or Downloads).**
- Or, a manual mountpoint to the second hard drive must be created in the configuration of VirtualBox (the provisioner running the virtual machine containing Docker Engine) as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48828406/unable-to-share-volume-with-docker-toolbox-on-windows-10).

The same problem could appear if you are using [Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (instead of the Docker Toolbox), a solution can be found [here](https://rominirani.com/docker-on-windows-mounting-host-directories-d96f3f056a2c).
