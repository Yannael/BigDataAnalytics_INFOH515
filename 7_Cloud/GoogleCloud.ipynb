    "\n",
    "Cloud service providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure all provide different solutions for setting up clusters with Big Data services such as Spark, Hadoop, or Yarn. Due to the large heterogeneity of user needs, cloud service providers offer many ways to set up and configure clusters, ranging from fine-grained solutions with detailed control on hardware and software configurations, to high-level services allowing to spin up preconfigured clusters with just a few mouse clicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely in this class on Google Cloud, and its [DataProc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) service. Google Cloud was chosen since, at the time of the writing of this class, it provided the safest (no charges unless explicitly authorized) and most attractive offer in terms of free credits (300 dollars over a three-month period) for testing their platform. The DataProc service was chosen since it allows to easily spin up a Spark/HDFS cluster, and interact with it from a Jupyter notebook. Note that there exists other ways to launch Spark/HDFS clusters with Google cloud, and that similar solutions exist with other cloud services providers such as AWS or Microsoft Azure.\n",

    "**Important notes regarding billing:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Important note 1:** In our experience, Google will not charge you unless you explicitly authorize it to do so. That is, once you run out of free credits, access to paid services will simply be suspended. **Keep in mind that this may change in the future, and do not take for granted that you will not be billed**.    \n",

    "* **Important note 2:** Billing concepts for cloud services are very complex. See here for an overview: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts?hl=en-GB. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Important note 3:** You may (and will) have bad surprises regarding billing. It is common, when starting a service that other services are also activated without you noticing. For example, starting a Spark cluster implicitly creates a Google bucket, for which you will also be charged. If you delete your cluster, but forget to delete the bucket, you will be charged until you delete the bucket. Another example concerns queries on big datasets, using for example the Google BigQuery service. In that case, billing depends on the amount of data that needed to be processed in order to answer your query. Even if your query seems simple (like select something from a table), if the table is huge, charges may be significant. There are many other examples of unexpected charges. **Therefore, always read carefully the documentation for the services you try**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Important note 4:** **Always delete everything you created after using a service, unless you want to keep it (and therefore pay for it)**. The last step of this class consists in properly deleting all of the services that were used. **Follow it carefully**.\n",
